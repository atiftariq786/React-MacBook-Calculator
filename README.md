# React-MacBook-Calculator 
This is a Macbook basic calculator version using the technologies listed below.This app is fully responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile users.I consider this a 'basic' calculator because it does not take order of operations into account during the calculation. For example, normally 3+3*3 is 12 but entering this equation into this calculator will give you 18 because this calculator does operations left to right only. 3+3 = 6, and 6*3 = 18.I developed this app to practice React. 

##  :robot:Technologies Used
*   **HTML5** and **CSS3** for page contentsand styling.
*   **React Bootstrap** most popular front-end framework.
*   **React.js** as a javaScript library for making the main structure of the app's UI.
*   **JavaScript** for the app's logic.
*   **ES6** ECMA script is the standardized name for javascript.
*   **NPM** for installation of packages required by the app.
